          Identifies goals that motivated the development of the project. The OntoUML/UFO Catalog Metadata Vocabulary (OCMV) provides a set of goals that be reused as recurrent modeling goals:

          - ocmv:ConceptualClarification: The project was created as the result of an ontological analysis of a concept, language, or domain of interest that sought to conceptually clarify and untangle complex notions and relations.

          - ocmv:DataPublication: The project was created to support the publication of some datasets. For instance, a conceptual model used to generate an OWL vocabulary to publish tabular data as linked open data on the web.

          - ocmv:DecisionSupportSystem: The project was created during the development of a decision support system.

          - ocmv:Example: The project was created to demonstrate how OntoUML can be used to solve a certain modeling challenge, to support an experiment involving OntoUML, or to exemplify how a generic model can be reused in more concrete scenarios.

          - ocmv:InformationRetrieval: The project was created to support the design of an information retrieval system.

          - ocmv:Interoperability: The project was created to support data integration, vocabulary alignment, or the interoperability of software systems.

          - ocmv:LanguageEngineering: The project was created for the design of a domain-specific modeling language.

          - ocmv:Learning: The project was created so that its authors could learn UFO and OntoUML. This usually applies to models developed by students as part of their course assignments.

          - ocmv:SoftwareEngineering: The project was created during the development of an information system. For instance, a conceptual model used to generate a relational database.

          Identifies the classifications of the project according to its scope. The OntoUML/UFO Catalog Metadata Vocabulary (OCMV) provides a set of recurrent modelling scopes based on the work of Roussey et al. (2011):

          - ocmv:Core: An ontology that grasps the central concepts and relations of a given domain, possibly integrating several domain ontologies and being applicable in multiple scenarios. E.g., UFO-S, a commitment-based ontology of services, can be considered a core ontology because it applies to services in multiple domains, such as medical, financial, and legal services.

          - ocmv:Domain: An ontology that describes how a community conceptualizes a phenomenon of interest. In general, a domain ontology formally characterizes a much narrower domain than a core ontology does. E.g., OntoBio is a domain ontology of biodiversity.

          - ocmv:Application: An ontology that specializes a domain ontology where there could be no consensus or knowledge sharing. It represents the particular model of a domain according to a single viewpoint of a user or a developer.

  #         Identifies a goal that motivated the development of the semantic artefact. To standardize the use of this property, we documented some recurrent modeling goals:
  #         - ocmv:ConceptualClarification: The artefact was created as the result of an ontological analysis of a concept, language, or domain of interest that sought to conceptually clarify and untangle complex notions and relations.
  #         - ocmv:DataPublication: The artefact was created to support the publication of some datasets. For instance, a conceptual model used to generate an OWL vocabulary to publish tabular data as linked open data on the web.
  #         - ocmv:DecisionSupportSystem: The artefact was created during the development of a decision support system.
  #         - ocmv:Example: The artefact was created to demonstrate how OntoUML can be used to solve a certain modeling challenge, to support an experiment involving OntoUML, or to exemplify how a generic model can be reused in more concrete scenarios.
  #         - ocmv:InformationRetrieval: The artefact was created to support the design of an information retrieval system.
  #         - ocmv:Interoperability: The artefact was created to support data integration, vocabulary alignment, or the interoperability of software systems.
  #         - ocmv:LanguageEngineering: The artefact was created for the design of a domain-specific modeling language.
  #         - ocmv:Learning: The artefact was created so that its authors could learn UFO and OntoUML. This usually applies to models developed by students as part of their course assignments.
  #         - ocmv:SoftwareEngineering: The artefact was created during the development of an information system. For instance, a conceptual model used to generate a relational database.
  #     context:
  #       title: context
  #       description: |-
  #         Identifies an ocmv:Context in which the artefact was developed, namely:
  #         - ocmv:Research: The artefact was developed as part of a research project. This usually implies that the artefact was featured in a scientific publication.
  #         - ocmv:Industry: The artefact was developed for a public or private organization.
  #         - ocmv:Classroom: The artefact was developed within the context of a course on conceptual modeling, most likely as a course assignment.
  #     representationStyle:
  #       title: representation style
  #       description: |-
  #         Identifies an ocmv:OntologyRepresentationStyle representation styles adopted in the artefact. We account for the existence of two values:
  #         - ocmv:OntoumlStyle: Characterizes a model that contains at least one class, relation, or property using a valid OntoUML stereotype.
  #         - ocmv:UfoStyle: Characterizes a model that contains at least one class or relation from UFO without an OntoUML stereotype.
  #     ontologyType:
  #       title: ontology type
  #       description: |-
  #         Identifies the categorization of the ontology according to its scope. For this catalog, we adopt the following three categories proposed by Roussey et al. [42]:
  #         - ocmv:Core: An ontology that grasps the central concepts and relations of a given do- main, possibly integrating several domain ontologies and being applicable in multiple scenarios. E.g., UFO-S, a commitment-based ontology of services, can be considered a core ontology because it applies to services in multiple domains, such as medical, financial, and legal services.
  #         - ocmv:Domain: An ontology that describes how a community conceptualizes a phenomenon of interest. In general, a domain ontology formally characterizes a much narrower domain than a core ontology does. E.g., OntoBio is a domain ontology of biodiversity.
  #         - ocmv:Application: An ontology that specializes a domain ontology where there could be no consensus or knowledge sharing. It represents the particular model of a domain according to a single viewpoint of a user or a developer.
